Brian Kessler is an American expat with a unique and diverse background. He came to Budapest for the third time in 2005 to be with a woman and teach English; though neither plan worked out, he fell in love with Hungary, its people, and its culture, staying until 2018. During this time, he resumed his work in computers and information technology.

Since 2007, Brian has specialized in Salesforce Apex while also having strong backgrounds in JavaScript and C#. He enjoys exploring other technologies such as Scala and Elixir. Brian is dedicated to quality, adhering to clean code, SOLID principles, and the test pyramid. He is passionate about integrating the best of OOP and FP into the Salesforce platform whenever possible.

Outside of programming, Brian is a skilled creative writer and dabbles in photography, drawing, theatre, music, and other arts. He cycles regularly for exercise and exploration.

Now resuming life in Budapest, Brian has recently joined Education First, ready to bring his expertise and passion to new challenges.
